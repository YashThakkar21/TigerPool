# Creating the Required Python Virtual Environment:

1.  Make sure you have python3.12 properly installed (and pip is upgraded).

2.  Using the 3.12 Python compiler/interpreter, create a virtual environment named TigerPool:

        > python3.12 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/TigerPool

3.  Activate the TigerPool virtual environment:

        > source ~/.virtualenvs/TigerPool/bin/activate

4.  Install the necessary requirements listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt):

        > pip install -r requirements.txt
